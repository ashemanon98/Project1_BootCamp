    Coulomb's law, or Coulomb's inverse-square law, is an experimental law of physics
    that quantifies the amount of force between two stationary, electrically charged
    particles. The electric force between charged bodies at rest is conventionally called
    electrostatic force or Coulomb force. The quantity of electrostatic force between
    stationary charges is always described by Coulomb's law. The law was first discovered
    in, by French physicist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, hence the name. Coulomb's law
    was essential to the development of the theory of electromagnetism, maybe even its 
    starting point,[1] as it made it possible to discuss the quantity of electric charge
    in a meaningful way.</br>

      <div style="padding-left:150px; font-size: 30px;">F= K&timesQ1&timesQ2/(r^2)</div> 
      where k is Coulomb's constant (k ≈ 8.99×10^9 N⋅m2⋅C−2), Q1 and Q2 are the signed
       magnitudes of the charges, and the scalar r is the distance between the charges.
        The force of the interaction between the charges is attractive if the charges have
         opposite signs (i.e., F is negative) and repulsive if like-signed (i.e., F is positive).
