        <h2>Ohms Law</h2>
        <p><a href="Ohms.html">

            Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two
             points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points.
              Introducing the constant of proportionality, the resistance, one arrives at 
              the usual mathematical equation that describes this relationship: I=V/R, where I 
              is the current through the conductor in units of amperes, V is the voltage measured 
              across the conductor in units of volts, and R is the resistance of the conductor in units of ohms.

            <h2>Coulombs Law</h2>
            <p><a href="Coulomb.html">
                Coulomb's law, or Coulomb's inverse-square law, is an experimental law 
                of physics that quantifies the amount of force between two stationary, 
                electrically charged particles. The electric force between charged bodies at 
                rest is conventionally called electrostatic force or Coulomb force. The quantity 
                of electrostatic force between stationary charges is always described by Coulomb's
                 law. The law was first discovered in 1785, by French physicist Charles-Augustin de
                  Coulomb, hence the name. Coulomb's law was essential to the development of the theory
                   of electromagnetism, maybe even its starting point, as it made it possible to discuss
                    the quantity of electric charge in a meaningful way.</a>

            <p><a href="HeatingANDpower.html">
                Calculating how much power your home needs is a matter of calculating the amperage 
                load of all the various appliances and fixtures, then building in a margin of safety.
                 Generally, it's recommended that the load never exceeds 80 percent of the electrical service's capacity.

            <h2>magnetic field of</br> a straight wire</h2>
            <p><a href="magneticField.html">
                Oersted discovered in 1820 that a current in a wire affected
                 a compass needle, he was not dealing with extremely large currents.
                  How does the shape of wires carrying current affect the shape of the
                   magnetic field created? We can use the Biot-Savart law to answer all 
                   of these questions, including determining the magnetic field of a long straight wire.

            <p><a href="faradayLaw.html">
                Faraday's law of induction (briefly, Faraday's law) is a basic law
                 of electromagnetism predicting how a magnetic field will interact
                  with an electric circuit to produce an electromotive force (EMF)â€”a
                   phenomenon known as electromagnetic induction. It is the fundamental
                    operating principle of transformers, inductors, and many types of 
                    electrical motors, generators and solenoids.</a>
