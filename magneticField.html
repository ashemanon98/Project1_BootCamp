    How much current is needed to produce a significant magnetic field, perhaps
    as strong as Earthâ€™s field? Surveyors will tell you that overhead electric
    power lines create magnetic fields that interfere with their compass readings.
    Indeed, when Oersted discovered in 1820 that a current in a wire affected a
    compass needle, he was not dealing with extremely large currents. How does the
    shape of wires carrying current affect the shape of the magnetic field created? 
    We noted in Chapter 28 that a current loop created a magnetic field similar to 
    that of a bar magnet, but what about a straight wire? We can use the Biot-Savart 
    law to answer all of these questions, including determining the magnetic field of 
    a long straight wire.
