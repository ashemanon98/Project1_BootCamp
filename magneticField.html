    How much current is needed to produce a significant magnetic field, perhaps
    as strong as Earthâ€™s field? Surveyors will tell you that overhead electric
    power lines create magnetic fields that interfere with their compass readings.
    Indeed, when Oersted discovered in 1820 that a current in a wire affected a
    compass needle, he was not dealing with extremely large currents. How does the
    shape of wires carrying current affect the shape of the magnetic field created? 
    it is known that  a current loop created a magnetic field similar to 
    that of a bar magnet, but what about a straight wire? We can use the Biot-Savart 
    law to answer all of these questions, including determining the magnetic field of 
    a long straight wire.
    The magnetic field lines of the infinite wire are circular and centered at the wire
     (as in Figure)), and they are identical in every plane perpendicular to the wire. 
     Since the field decreases with distance from the wire, the spacing of the field lines 
     must increase correspondingly with distance. The direction of this magnetic field may 
     be found with a second form of the right-hand rule (illustrated in (Figure)). If you 
     hold the wire with your right hand so that your thumb points along the current, then your 
     fingers wrap around the wire in the same sense as B.
     Some magnetic field lines of an infinite wire. The direction of B can be 
     found with a form of the right-hand rule. and the magnitude can be found using the following formula</br>
     <div style="padding-left:150px; font-size: 30px;">B= &mu;&times;I/2&times&pi;&timesR</div>
