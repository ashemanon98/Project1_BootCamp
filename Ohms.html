    Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is
     directly proportional to the voltage across the two points. Introducing the
      constant of proportionality, the resistance, one arrives at the usual
       mathematical equation that describes this relationship.</br>

</p>
<p>

    he law was named after the German physicist Georg Ohm, who, in a treatise
     published in 1827, described measurements of applied voltage and current
      through simple electrical circuits containing various lengths of wire.
       Ohm explained his experimental results by a slightly more complex equation
        than the modern form above.

    In physics, the term Ohm's law is also used to refer to various generalizations
     of the law; for example the vector form of the law used in electromagnetics and material science:

      <br> <div style="padding-left:150px; font-size: 30px;">J=&sigma;E</div>                 </br>
   where J is the current density at a given location in a resistive material, E is the electric field 
   at that location, and Ïƒ (sigma) is a material-dependent parameter called the conductivity. This
    reformulation of Ohm's law is due to Gustav Kirchhoff.[4]

    <h3>Scope</h3>
    Ohm's law is an empirical law, a generalization from many experiments that have shown that current 
    is approximately proportional to electric field for most materials. It is less fundamental than Maxwell's
    equations and is not always obeyed. Any given material will break down under a strong-enough electric field,
    and some materials of interest in electrical engineering are "non-ohmic" under weak fields.
    Ohm's law has been observed on a wide range of length scales. In the early 20th century, it was thought that Ohm's 
    law would fail at the atomic scale, but experiments have not borne out this expectation. As of 2012, researchers
     have demonstrated that Ohm's law works for silicon wires as small as four atoms wide and one atom high.
