Objective: 
the objective of the website is to make physics easy and fun for high school and freshman college students. </b>
Methodology: 
The methods used are by giving explanations and sample solved problems and let the student play with the web app platform. It also give them a calculator for all formulas introduced. </b>
Design: 
The design has a home page in the home page there are links to every topic of physics concept covered. Then the user picks a link and gets explanation of concepts and references. Then the user plays with the webappâ€™s calculator. In every link there is also a way to go to every other link and homepage.
Functionality:
there are six physics concepts covered. all the concepts have a description and a calculator part. the concepts can be accessed by the contact menu or on the home page there is a basic descrition of them. then students can use the calculator to calculate the results and check theri answer. 
Improvemement:
this can include the simulation of many senarios to how we can experiments are done and the content can alos be expanded to cover the many physics concepst of general physics for high school and freshman college sttudents.
Technology used:
I used the css to define the layout and used Html to develop the text. I also used Javascript to process the forms.
